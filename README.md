# Overview
	
	Maria and her supervisor have been notified that a file sent to them has shown evidence of academic dishonesty. The file is question is the students_complete.csv file. The file shows evidence of altered reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth graders. The board does not know the full story of the academic dishonesty, so that they asked Maria to help. Our job is to assist Maria by updating the scores for Thomas High School ninth graders while keeping the remaining data the same. After completing the analysis, she would like a report to describe how the changes affect the overall analysis previously completed.
